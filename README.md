# Diabetic_Retinopathy_Detector
## Deep learning diabetic retinopathy detector with eye image input

Please see pdf file "Findings_Report" for information about the development of the model.

Jupyter notebook "diabetic_retinopathy_detector" contains the code used.

Excel file "Metrics_Report" contains summarized metrics.

There is also a related powerpoint "Presentation_Slide_Deck".

The intention was to include saved models as well, but the sizes of the files were too big for github, which has a 25MB file size limit.
