# Diabetic_Retinopathy_Detector
Deep learning diabetic retinopathy detector with eye image input

Please see pdf files Findings_Report and Metrics_Report for more information on the development of the model.

Jupyter notebook "diabetic_retinopathy_detector.ipynb" contains the code used.

The intention was to include saved models as well, but the sizes of the files were too big for github, which has a 25MB file size limit.
